Occasionally it has been stated that soft tissue remains have been found inside fossil dinosaur bones, most famously by Mary Schweitzer who claimed to have found blood cell and protein remains in a tyrannosaurus bone. Schweitzers finds were highly controversial both for their validity and because her research required breaking open the bones or dissolving them in acid to get at the tissue inside. More recent finds from other fossil dinosaurs have vindicated Schweitzer.
