Rupert Sheldrake’s Morphic resonance or morphic field theory is that a natural telepathy of living collective unconsciousness exists between all things, leading him to ask in ‘Presence of the Past’ (1988),  if dinosaurs have gone extinct, “what has happened to their morphic fields?” According to Sheldrake they “still exist [...] but there are no appropriate tuning systems, like living dinosaur eggs, that can pick them up by morphic resonance.” Sheldrake did suggest that through atavism (Devolution) a creature could be born which would tune in to the morphic frequency of the dinosaurs and lead to their reappearance.
